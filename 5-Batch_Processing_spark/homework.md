SELECT count(*) FROM trips_1024 
WHERE DATE(pickup_date) = '2024-10-15';
""").show()

```

Answer:

```
128097   
```

## Question 4: Longest trip

spark.sql("""
SELECT 
    (unix_timestamp(tpep_dropoff_datetime) - unix_timestamp(tpep_pickup_datetime)) / 3600 AS trip_duration
FROM trips_1024
ORDER BY trip_duration DESC
LIMIT 5;
""").show()

lookup_df = spark.read.option("header", "true").csv('taxi_zone_lookup.csv')

lookup_df.registerTempTable('lookup_df')  

spark.sql("""

SELECT lookup_df.Zone , count(*) as count_trips FROM trips_1024 
INNER JOIN lookup_df ON lookup_df.LocationID = trips_1024.PULocationID
GROUP BY lookup_df.Zone
ORDER BY count_trips ASC;
""").show()  

```
